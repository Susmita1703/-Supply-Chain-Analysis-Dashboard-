# Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

## Objective üéØ
Develop an interactive Excel dashboard to provide insights and help optimize the supply chain operations. The dashboard allows stakeholders to track sales, profit, delivery efficiency, and identify trends in product sales and delivery times.

Key metrics visualized:
- **Total Sales**: ‚Çπ6,181,476
- **Total Order Quantity**: 66,367
- **Total Profit**: ‚Çπ3,991,492
- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: 23.2%
- **Delivery Before Time**: 37%
- **Delivery After Time**: 46.5%
- **Top Products by Sales** and **Regions by Sales**

## Contents üìù
1. **Data**: The raw data used to create this dashboard is included as an Excel file.
2. **Analysis**: Details on the process of calculating key metrics, handling missing data, and transforming raw data into actionable insights.
3. **Visualization**: The interactive dashboard built in Excel for supply chain analysis.
4. **Documentation**: Step-by-step guide to understanding the data, creating the dashboard, and interpreting the results.

## Project Workflow:
### 1. Data Collection and Understanding:
- The dataset used was from sales and supply chain data in Excel format, with columns including **sales**, **order quantity**, **profit**, **delivery time**, and **shipment mode**. 
- A detailed description of the data structure and contents can be found in the [Data Overview](https://github.com/Susmita1703/-Supply-Chain-Analysis-Dashboard-/blob/main/data.zip) file.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
- Data was cleaned within Excel using built-in functions. Inconsistent records were addressed, and missing data was handled by applying appropriate measures such as filling in values or removing incomplete entries.
- The following steps were performed to clean the data:
  - Removal of duplicates.
  - Validation of delivery dates.
  - Calculation of derived metrics like total profit and average order value. 

### 3. Dashboard Design:
- The **Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard** was designed in Excel, offering insights on key metrics:
  - **Top 5 Products by Sales**
  - **Sales Trends by Region**
  - **Delivery Performance Metrics** (on-time, before time, after time)
  - **Discounts and Lead Times** for top products.

### 4. Business Questions Addressed:
The dashboard was designed to answer key business questions, such as:
- Which products are generating the most revenue?
- How efficient is the delivery system?
- Which regions have the highest sales volume?

These insights help in decision-making for optimizing the supply chain. For detailed results of the analysis, view the [Insights Document](https://github.com/Susmita1703/-Supply-Chain-Analysis-Dashboard-/blob/main/Supply%20chain%20analysis%20dashboard.jpg).

### 5. Visualization:
The final Excel dashboard can be downloaded [here](#). The interactive elements such as filters for **year** and **shipment mode** allow users to explore different aspects of the supply chain.

Below is a preview of the dashboard:
